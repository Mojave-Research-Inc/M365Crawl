# Frequently Asked Questions - M365 Brain Crawl

## Getting Started Questions

### **Q: I'm not technical - can I really set this up myself?**
**A:** Yes! The setup is designed for business users. You just need to:
- Copy and paste one command in Azure Cloud Shell
- Wait 10 minutes while it sets everything up automatically  
- Click "Accept" when it asks for Microsoft 365 permissions
- That's it! No programming or technical knowledge required.

### **Q: What exactly is "Azure Cloud Shell"?**
**A:** It's just a command window that Microsoft provides in your web browser. Think of it like a calculator, but for running setup commands. You don't need to install anything - just go to portal.azure.com and click the shell icon (>_) at the top.

### **Q: How much will this cost me?**
**A:** For most small to medium businesses, expect $5-25 per month in Azure costs. It only costs money when it's actually working, and you can see exactly what you're spending in the Azure portal. You can also set up spending limits so it never goes over your budget.

### **Q: Do I need special permissions to set this up?**
**A:** You need two things:
- **Azure permissions** - ability to create resources (usually "Contributor" role)
- **Microsoft 365 admin rights** - to approve the system's access to your data
- If you don't have these, ask your IT administrator to help with the setup

## Security and Privacy Questions

### **Q: Is my data safe? What security does this have?**
**A:** Yes, your data is very secure. The system uses:
- **Enterprise encryption** - All data is encrypted when transferred
- **Microsoft security standards** - Same security as Office 365
- **Admin approval required** - Only authorized people can grant access
- **No permanent storage** - Data isn't kept unless you specifically configure it
- **Audit trails** - You can see exactly what was accessed and when

### **Q: Can this system read my private emails or personal information?**
**A:** The system only accesses what you specifically give it permission to see. By default, it focuses on:
- Teams messages and channels (business communications)
- SharePoint sites and documents (shared business files)
- User directories (employee information)
- Calendar metadata (meeting patterns, not content)

It **cannot** access personal emails, private OneDrive files, or personal calendar details unless you specifically grant those permissions.

### **Q: Who can see the data this system collects?**
**A:** Only people you give access to. The system doesn't share data with Microsoft, third parties, or anyone else. You control:
- Who can run the system
- What data it collects
- Where results are stored
- Who can see the results

### **Q: What if I want to remove everything later?**
**A:** You can completely delete the system and all its data by:
- Going to Azure Portal → Resource Groups → "m365-agent-rg"
- Clicking "Delete resource group"
- Confirming the deletion
- Everything is permanently removed, and billing stops immediately

## Technical Questions (Simplified)

### **Q: What happens if the system breaks or stops working?**
**A:** The system includes automatic monitoring and recovery:
- **Health checks** - Tells you if something is wrong
- **Automatic restarts** - Fixes most problems by itself
- **Error messages** - Gives clear explanations when things fail
- **Support resources** - Built-in help and troubleshooting guides

If something does break, you can usually fix it by re-running the setup script, which is safe to do multiple times.

### **Q: Can this handle a large organization with thousands of users?**
**A:** Yes! The system is designed to scale automatically:
- **Small organizations** (< 100 users): Works perfectly
- **Medium organizations** (100-1000 users): Handles easily  
- **Large enterprises** (1000+ users): Scales up automatically
- **Multiple organizations**: Can connect to many different companies

The Azure cloud infrastructure adjusts automatically based on your needs.

### **Q: How often does it collect new data?**
**A:** The system collects data when you ask it to. It doesn't run continuously by default. You can:
- **Manual collection** - Run it when you need new data
- **Scheduled collection** - Set it to run automatically (daily, weekly, etc.)
- **Event-triggered** - Collect data when specific things happen
- **Real-time monitoring** - Watch for changes as they happen

## Usage and Functionality Questions

### **Q: What kind of insights can I actually get from this?**
**A:** The system provides business-relevant information like:
- **Team collaboration patterns** - Which departments work together most
- **Content usage** - Which files and sites are actually being used
- **Communication trends** - How teams prefer to communicate
- **Project discovery** - What active projects exist in your organization
- **Security risks** - Files or data that might need better protection
- **Storage optimization** - What data can be archived or deleted

### **Q: Can I connect multiple Microsoft 365 organizations?**
**A:** Yes! This is perfect for:
- **Consulting firms** - Connect to multiple client organizations
- **Managed service providers** - Monitor many customer tenants
- **Multi-company businesses** - Connect subsidiaries and divisions
- **Mergers and acquisitions** - Analyze multiple organizations

Each organization's data stays completely separate and secure.

### **Q: Do I need to be a data analyst to understand the results?**
**A:** No! The system is designed to provide clear, business-friendly information:
- **Plain English reports** - No technical jargon
- **Visual charts and graphs** - Easy to understand at a glance  
- **Executive summaries** - Key points highlighted
- **Actionable recommendations** - Specific suggestions for improvement

You'll get insights like "Department A collaborates 40% more than Department B" rather than complex technical data.

### **Q: Can this replace our current Microsoft 365 analytics tools?**
**A:** It complements rather than replaces existing tools:
- **Microsoft 365 admin center** - Good for basic usage statistics
- **This system** - Better for detailed analysis and cross-organizational insights
- **Power BI** - You can feed this system's data into Power BI for advanced visualization
- **Third-party tools** - Can work alongside other business intelligence systems

## Troubleshooting Questions

### **Q: The setup failed - what do I do?**
**A:** Most setup issues are easy to fix:

1. **"Not logged into Azure"** - Close and reopen Azure Cloud Shell
2. **"Missing permissions"** - Ask your IT admin for "Contributor" access  
3. **"Storage account creation failed"** - Try running the script again (it's safe)
4. **"Function app not responding"** - Wait 2-3 minutes and test again

The setup script can be run multiple times safely, so trying again often fixes temporary issues.

### **Q: I approved the permissions but the system says it can't connect to Microsoft 365**
**A:** This usually means:
- **Wait a few minutes** - Permissions take time to activate
- **Check the admin consent** - Make sure you clicked "Accept" for all permissions
- **Verify your admin role** - You need Microsoft 365 Global Admin or Application Admin rights
- **Try the test endpoint** - Visit your-system-url/api/test to see detailed status

### **Q: The system is collecting data but I can't understand the results**
**A:** The data comes in a technical format initially. You can:
- **Use the built-in test endpoints** - They provide human-readable summaries
- **Export to Excel or CSV** - Most data can be opened in familiar tools
- **Check the documentation** - Examples of common analysis tasks
- **Contact support** - Most issues are common and easily resolved

### **Q: My Azure bill is higher than expected - how do I control costs?**
**A:** Azure provides several cost control options:
- **Set spending limits** - Automatically stop services at your budget limit
- **Monitor usage daily** - Check Azure Cost Management regularly
- **Use scheduling** - Only run data collection when needed
- **Optimize settings** - Reduce data collection frequency or scope

You can also completely pause or delete the system anytime to stop all charges.

## Business Questions

### **Q: Is this legal to use on our Microsoft 365 data?**
**A:** Yes, as long as you:
- **Have proper authorization** - Admin approval to access the data
- **Follow your organization's policies** - IT and data governance rules
- **Respect privacy laws** - GDPR, CCPA, or other applicable regulations
- **Use it for legitimate business purposes** - Analysis, optimization, compliance

The system is designed to help with legitimate business analysis, not inappropriate surveillance.

### **Q: Can our IT department see what I'm doing with this system?**
**A:** IT visibility depends on your organization's setup:
- **Azure resources** - IT admins can see what's created in Azure
- **Microsoft 365 permissions** - M365 admins can see what permissions were granted
- **Usage logs** - Some activity appears in Microsoft 365 audit logs
- **Data access** - Only people you specifically authorize can see the results

This is normal and appropriate for enterprise tools - IT should know what systems are accessing company data.

### **Q: What happens if I leave the company? Can someone else take over?**
**A:** Yes, the system can be transferred:
- **Azure resources** - Can be transferred to a different Azure account
- **App registrations** - Can be managed by other Microsoft 365 admins
- **Documentation** - All setup instructions are included
- **No vendor lock-in** - You own and control everything

It's a good practice to document who has access and how to transfer control before you need to.

### **Q: How is this different from expensive enterprise data analytics solutions?**
